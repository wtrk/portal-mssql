            permission for your Wiley account to be linked to your third-party account.</p>
          <h2 id="3">Information We Receive from Other Sources</h2>
          <p>Wiley may receive information about you if you use any of the websites we operate or the other services we
            provide. We also work closely with third parties (including, for example, business partners and

            providers; academic institutions; journal owners, societies and similar organizations; search information

            following: providing direct marketing and assessing the effectiveness of promotions and advertising;
            modifying, improving or personalizing our services, products and communications; detecting fraud;
            investigating suspicious activity (e.g., violations of our Terms of Service, which can be found <a
              href="/terms-of-use/">here</a>) and otherwise keeping our site safe and secure; and conducting data
            analytics.</p>
          <p>In addition, with your prior, explicit consent (where required), we may use your information in the
            following ways:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>To provide you with information about products and services that you request from us;</li>
            <li>To send you periodic&nbsp;catalogues&nbsp;from Wiley;</li>
            <li>To provide you with information about other products, events and services we offer that are either (i)
              similar to those you have already purchased or inquired about, or (ii) entirely new products,
              events&nbsp;and&nbsp;services;</li>
            <li>For internal business and research purposes to help enhance, evaluate, develop, and create Wiley
              websites (including usage statistics, such as “page views” on Wiley’s websites and the products therein),
              products, and services;</li>
            <li>To notify you about changes or updates to our websites, products, or services;</li>
            <li>To provide, activate, and/or manage our services;</li>
            <li>For internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, machine learning, testing,
              statistical, and survey purposes;</li>

            <li>Where necessary in connection with services provided by third parties (i) who provide us with a wide
              range of office, administrative, information technology, website and platform hosting, editing,

            <li>Where Wiley is required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public
              authorities and government agencies, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements;
              to comply with a subpoena or other legal process; when we believe in good faith that disclosure is

            <li>Where you have subscribed to journals, elected to receive electronic alerts about journals or your
              contribution to one of our journals has been accepted for publication, we may share your information with
              the journal owner or a society or organization associated with the journal; or</li>
            <li>Where you have attended an event, webinar, or conference, we may share your information with the sponsor

              interest in making the disclosure.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Wiley also&nbsp; may disclose navigational and transactional information in the form of anonymous,
            aggregate usage statistics and&nbsp;demographic&nbsp;information that does not reveal your identity or

          <p>Wiley may transfer your personal information outside of your country of residence for the following
            reasons:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>In order to process your transactions, we may store your personal information on our servers and those
              servers may reside outside the country where you live. Wiley has servers and major office locations in
              several countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Singapore, Brazil,
              India&nbsp;and&nbsp;Australia. Wiley also has service providers located in India and the Philippines
              amongst other countries. Such processing may include, among other things, the fulfillment of your order,

            <li>In order to satisfy global reporting requirements, Wiley may be required to provide your personal

          </ul>
          <p>By submitting your personal information, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing of your

            securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and all applicable data protection laws.</p>
          <p>In relation to personal data processed within the US, Wiley has in place EU Model Clauses between entities
            within its group of companies that receive and process personal information from countries within the
            European Economic Area.</p>
          <h2 id="8">Security</h2>
          <p>We will use appropriate physical, technical and administrative safeguards to protect your data.&nbsp;
            Access to your personal data will be restricted to only those who need to know that information and required
            to perform their job function.&nbsp; In addition, we train our employees about the importance of maintaining
            the confidentiality and security of your information.</p>
          <h2 id="5">Disclosure in Chat Rooms or Forums</h2>
          <p>You should be aware that identifiable personal information — such as your name or e-mail address — that you
            voluntarily disclose and that is accessible to other users (e.g. on social media, forums, bulletin boards or
            in chat areas) could be collected and disclosed by others. Wiley cannot take any responsibility for such
            collection and disclosure.</p>
          <h2 id="9">Cookies</h2>
          <p>As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically. This information may include IP
            addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (“ISP”), referring/exit pages, the files viewed on our
            site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data to
            analyze trends in the aggregate and administer the site.</p>
          <p>Wiley and its partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track
            users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
            You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it
            may limit your use of certain features or functions on our website or services.</p>
          <p>Under the <a href="#15">California Consumer Privacy Act</a>, California residents have the right to opt-out
            of the “sale” of their personal information to third parties. While Wiley does not believe that its use of
            Web cookies constitutes a “sale” of personal information under CCPA, Wiley has published the “Do Not Sell My
            Personal Information” page to offer the opt-out option to California residents.</p>

              involving your personal information, and what transfer safeguards we have in place;</li>
            <li>Request that we rectify any errors in your personal information;</li>

            <li>Object to automated decision-making and profiling based on legitimate interests or the performance of a

              legitimate grounds, such as when the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract between
              us);</li>
            <li>Object to direct marketing from us; and</li>
            <li>Object to processing for purposes of scientific, historical research and statistics.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Where applicable under your local laws, we will not use your personal information for marketing purposes,
            nor disclose your information to any third parties, unless we have your prior consent, which we will seek
            before collecting your personal information. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by
            checking certain boxes on the consent forms we use when collecting your personal information. If at any
            point you wish to review or change your preferences you can use the “opt-out” or unsubscribe mechanism or

          <h3>Information About Data We Have Collected or Disclosed About You</h3>

            residents. You have the right to request that we provide, not more than twice every 12 months, certain
            information about the data we have collected or disclosed about you over the past 12 months, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>the categories of personal information we have collected about you;</li>
            <li>the categories of sources from which we have collected your personal information;</li>
            <li>the business or commercial purpose for collecting your personal information;</li>

            <li>the categories of personal information that we have disclosed about you for a business purpose.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>For the purposes of your rights as a California resident, “personal information” means any non-publicly
            available information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could

          <h3 id="17">Disclosure of Personal Information</h3>
          <p>For certain of our business functions, we may disclose personal information for a business purpose. When we

            collection and disclosure.</p>

          <h2 id="11">Your Rights</h2>
          <p>You have the right to make a written request to be informed whether or not we hold or process any of your

            request, you may:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Request that we provide you with details of your personal information that we process, the purpose for
              which it is processed, the recipients of such information, the existence of any automated decision making
              involving your personal information, and what transfer safeguards we have in place;</li>
            <li>Request that we rectify any errors in your personal information;</li>
            <li>Request that we delete your personal information if our continued processing of such information is not
              justified;</li>
            <li>Request that we transfer your personal information to a third party;</li>
            <li>Object to automated decision-making and profiling based on legitimate interests or the performance of a
              task in the public interest (in which event the processing will cease except where there are compelling
              legitimate grounds, such as when the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract between
              us);</li>
            <li>Object to direct marketing from us; and</li>
            <li>Object to processing for purposes of scientific, historical research and statistics.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Where applicable under your local laws, we will not use your personal information for marketing purposes,
            nor disclose your information to any third parties, unless we have your prior consent, which we will seek
            before collecting your personal information. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by
            checking certain boxes on the consent forms we use when collecting your personal information. If at any
            point you wish to review or change your preferences you can use the “opt-out” or unsubscribe mechanism or

          <h2 id="15">Your California Data Privacy Rights</h2>
          <h3>Information About Data We Have Collected or Disclosed About You</h3>
          <p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) provides additional data privacy rights to California
            residents. You have the right to request that we provide, not more than twice every 12 months, certain
            information about the data we have collected or disclosed about you over the past 12 months, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>the categories of personal information we have collected about you;</li>
            <li>the categories of sources from which we have collected your personal information;</li>
            <li>the business or commercial purpose for collecting your personal information;</li>
            <li>the categories of third parties with whom we share your personal information;</li>
            <li>the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you; and</li>
            <li>the categories of personal information that we have disclosed about you for a business purpose.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>For the purposes of your rights as a California resident, “personal information” means any non-publicly
            available information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could
            reasonably be linked with you or your household, such as biometric information or information about your
            location.</p>
          <h3 id="17">Disclosure of Personal Information</h3>
          <p>For certain of our business functions, we may disclose personal information for a business purpose. When we
            disclose personal information for a business purpose, the third party must agree to retain, use, or disclose
            the personal information solely for the business purpose. We prohibit the third party from selling the
            personal information that we provide [for a business purpose]. In the past 12 months, depending on how you
            interact with Wiley, we may have disclosed your information as set forth in the section above entitled
            “Disclosure and Sharing of Your information.”</p>
          <h3 id="16">Deletion of Data</h3>
          <p>California residents also have the right to request that we delete the personal information we have
            collected from you (and direct our service providers to do so), except where retaining your personal
            information is necessary for Wiley to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Complete your transaction, provide a good or service you requested, or perform a contract between you
              and us;</li>
            <li>Protect you or us from security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal
              activity, or prosecute those responsible for that activity;</li>
            <li>Fix errors in our systems;</li>
            <li>Protect your, our, or others’ right to free speech, or exercise another right provided for by law;</li>
            <li>Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (California Penal Code Section 1546 and
              following);</li>
            <li>Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest
              that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws;</li>
            <li>Use your personal information internally in a way that is reasonably aligned with your expectations
              based on your relationship with us or in another lawful manner that is compatible with the context in
              which you provided the information; or</li>
            <li>Comply with a legal obligation.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 id="18">“Do Not Track” (for California and Delaware Residents)</h3>

            transmitted by web browsers. For more information about “do not track”, go to&nbsp;<a

          </p>
          <h3 id="19">How to Exercise Your Rights</h3>
          <p>To exercise your rights under CCPA, you may submit a verifiable consumer request to us by phone at (800)
            438-6643 or by email at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@wiley.com">privacy@wiley.com</a>. Only you, a person
            registered with the Secretary of State authorized to act on your behalf, or you on behalf of your minor
            child may submit a verifiable consumer request. The request must provide enough information for us to
            reasonably verify you are, or are the authorized representative of, the person about whom we collected
            personal information.</p>

          <p>If we ask a child age 13 or under to provide us with certain information such as the child’s full name,
            home address, email address, telephone number, age information or any other information that would allow
            someone to identify or contact the child, we ask for a parent or guardian’s consent for a child to provide
            that information. We may use the parent’s email address to seek the parent’s consent or notify the parent of
            his/her child’s online activities. We do not share the children’s information with outside third parties not
            bound by this Privacy Policy for their own marketing purposes. If you would like to review any personal
            information that we have collected online from your child, have this information deleted from our active
            servers, and/or request that there be no further collection or use of your child’s information or if you
            have questions about these information practices, you may contact us at <a
